Script for creating demo website for Keller Williams:

0. Deploy latest version of code to production server
prd$ cd /u/apps
prd$ sudo chown -R brian:brian barrioearth.com
dev> cap deploy
prd$ sudo chown -R mongrel:mongrel barrioearth.com
prd$ sudo /etc/init.d/mongrel_cluster restart

1. Start with fresh database
mysql> DROP DATABASE `barrioearth_production`;
mysql> CREATE DATABASE `barrioearth_production`;

2. Load legacy data into temporary database
mysql> CREATE DATABASE `barrioearth_legacy`;
$ mysqldump --opt --user=be_user_php -pmastod0n barrioearth_php --ignore-table=barrioearth_php.visitorlog --ignore-table=barrioearth_php.ip_to_country | mysql -u be_user_legacy -pmarin3r barrioearth_legacy

3. Convert to utf8
$ cd /u/apps/barrioearth.com/current
$ sudo rake db:convert:to_utf8 RAILS_ENV=production

4. Initialize production database
$ sudo rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production

5. Populate production database with seed data
$ sudo rake db:seed RAILS_ENV=production

6. Migrate legacy data from temporary database into production database
$ sudo rake db:migrate:legacy RAILS_ENV=production

Migration
-When migrating legacy data, accented characters cause strings to be cut off.
*I converted the legacy database to utf8, so check if this fixes the problem
-Make sure category/style/feature_assignments get assigned for "rent" and "sale"
when "both" is indicated
-Save default market segment images in separate directory and add logic to
seed data to create these records. Need to find more/better stock images
-Jaco barrio is being mapped to Parrita... this is the name of the canton, but
the barrio should be Jaco
  
Visual
-Sweet-looking home page (agency:show)
  -featured listing(s)
  -intro text
  -links
-Make arrows more prominent in gliders (or highlight them on page load)
-Allow admin to choose color scheme
-Allow users to choose to filter by a different category/place than the
currently selected one. Right now they have to undo the current filter, for
example by clicking "All barrios" and then select another barrio. The options
available should be like this:
  *Category/Style/Country -> other categories/styles/countries
  *Zone -> other zones in current country
  *Province -> other provinces in current country
  *Canton -> other cantons in current a)province if province selected or
    b)zone if zone selected
  *Barrio -> other barrios in current a)canton if canton selected or b)market
    if market selected
-Allow users to select more than one feature to filter by. Use checkboxes
in filter menu plus "filter" link that submits a form with GET method instead
of just simple links that only allow constraining by a single feature at a time.
-Constrain filter options to only those that actually exist in current result
set.
-Filter by bedroom and bathroom number

-Smooth out featured/similar/etc. glider shiznit
  -number of images
  xdeal with missing images
  -prevent manipulation of glider while gliding
  -better watermark
  -overlay text? price, name, etc.
  -overlay image, such as a title as a graphic instead of text?
-Pretty up filters/sorts
-Make "more info" arrow more obvious on listings
-Make "more info" section look slick (agent pic, description, etc.)
-Better main navigation links
-Better right margin links, pics, ads, etc.
-Keep contact buttons?

Logic
-Checked boxes should be added to "highlighted" array so they always appear
at top of filter lists
-Clean up crazy SQL selects
  -Why are some so long?
  -Move as much as possible to model, i.e. named routes
  -Eager load appropriately
-Disallow commas from categories, features, and styles so that parameters can
be safely assumed to be delimited with commas
-Disallow slashes and other characters from names (or change friendly_id's
default behavior with these characters) because when converted into cached
slugs these cause the parts of the word to lose a space (and therefore become
unrecognizable as distinct words to search engines). For example, "den/office"
becomes "denoffice"


Routing
-Add flag to preserve pagination options in listings_options() (default false)
-Change all spaces in URL to dashes


Admin section
-better navigation
-fix any inevitable problems due to new changes such as new/deleted fields

Database changes
xAdd "highlighted" flag to cat/feat/style_assignments tables so that the most
  commonly used options can be presented in menus first (order by popular
  DESC). Use a javascript "-more-" toggle to see the full list.
  -integrate into admin forms (already done for feature assignments)
-Add "highlighted" flag to barrios & cantons as well?

Miscellaneous
xCreate admin-only version of client views that is never cached, so that
admins can easily navigate listings with admin-only links and content
available (which obviously can't be cached). Easiest implementation seems
like it would be to have separate routing for this like /listings instead of
/real_estate
-Maybe change features so that they are more alphabetically sensible. EX:
"front garden" should be re-written as "garden (front)"
-Why isn't washer/dryer one of the features that appear on the feature filter?

Web server configuration
-Automatically update apache config file for domain aliases so that when admins
change domain and/or subdomains, the apache configuration is updated
automatically
