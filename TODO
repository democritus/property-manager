Migration
-When migrating legacy data, accented characters cause strings to be cut off.
*I converted the legacy database to utf8, so check if this fixes the problem
-Make sure category/style/feature_assignments get assigned for "rent" and "sale"
when "both" is indicated
-Save default market segment images in separate directory and add logic to
seed data to create these records. Need to find more/better stock images
-Jaco barrio is being mapped to Parrita... this is the name of the canton, but
the barrio should be Jaco
  
Visual
-Sweet-looking home page (agency:show)
  -featured listing(s)
  -intro text
  -links
-Make arrows more prominent in gliders (or highlight them on page load)
-Allow admin to choose color scheme
-Allow users to choose to filter by a different category/place than the
currently selected one. Right now they have to undo the current filter, for
example by clicking "All barrios" and then select another barrio. The options
available should be like this:
  *Category/Style/Country -> other categories/styles/countries
  *Zone -> other zones in current country
  *Province -> other provinces in current country
  *Canton -> other cantons in current a)province if province selected or
    b)zone if zone selected
  *Barrio -> other barrios in current a)canton if canton selected or b)market
    if market selected
-Allow users to select more than one feature to filter by. Use checkboxes
in filter menu plus "filter" link that submits a form with GET method instead
of just simple links that only allow constraining by a single feature at a time.
-Constrain filter options to only those that actually exist in current result
set.

-Smooth out featured/similar/etc. glider shiznit
  -number of images
  xdeal with missing images
  -prevent manipulation of glider while gliding
  -better watermark
  -overlay text? price, name, etc.
  -overlay image, such as a title as a graphic instead of text?
-Pretty up filters/sorts
-Make "more info" arrow more obvious on listings
-Make "more info" section look slick (agent pic, description, etc.)
-Better main navigation links
-Better right margin links, pics, ads, etc.
-Keep contact buttons?

Logic
-Clean up crazy SQL selects
  -Why are some so long?
  -Move as much as possible to model, i.e. named routes
  -Eager load appropriately

Admin section
-better navigation
-fix any inevitable problems due to new changes such as new/deleted fields

Database changes
xAdd "highlighted" flag to cat/feat/style_assignments tables so that the most
  commonly used options can be presented in menus first (order by popular
  DESC). Use a javascript "-more-" toggle to see the full list.
  -integrate into admin forms (already done for feature assignments)
-Add "highlighted" flag to barrios & cantons as well?

Miscellaneous
xCreate admin-only version of client views that is never cached, so that
admins can easily navigate listings with admin-only links and content
available (which obviously can't be cached). Easiest implementation seems
like it would be to have separate routing for this like /listings instead of
/real_estate
  
Web server configuration
-Automatically update apache config file for domain aliases so that when admins
change domain and/or subdomains, the apache configuration is updated
automatically
