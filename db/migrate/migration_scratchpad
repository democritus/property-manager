# TODO:
- Site should work with a single agency (master agency) without domain or
subdomain specified so that admin can choose
- Site should work with agency NOT associated with market segment so that admin
can choose

- Seed data needed:
  - Markets in CR
  - Market segment images grabbed (via Fleximage-enhanced create) from static directory
  

- What to do with canton/barrio?
